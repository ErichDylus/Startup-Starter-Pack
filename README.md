# Startup Starter Pack ⚡
[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/Startup-Upstarts/community.png)](https://gitter.im/Startup-Upstarts/community)

Collection of model legal documents for typical startup setup and fundraising needs. See also ["Starters" Guide (WIP)](https://startup-starter-pack.gitbook.io/starters/).

> The problem, as Brad Feld points out, is that nobody has done the work to get all the various players in the room and standardize on one form. . . I guess it's like open source software in that there are many flavors of it out there. One project might choose MongoDB for their project. Another might choose Cassandra. A third might choose Hadoop. All will get the job done and all are open source. But each one has its strengths and weaknesses and there is no standard. That's ok with me as long as everyone understands it.

### |🏗️| Incorporation |🏛️|

#### 📋 Certificate of Incorporation:

> *A Certificate of Incorporation is a document submitted by a business within the state it wishes to be headquartered. For example, a Delaware company only exists after the Secretary of State has received a company’s certificate of incorporation. Usually, this document is short because there are only a few requirements for it to provide enough information to the state.*

### |📜| Financing |💰|

> [**Series Seed**](https://github.com/CooleyLLP/seriesseed): a standardized set of legal documents that can be quickly and easily deployed for a seed investment round. Startup Starter Pack utilizes Cooley LLP's "Series Seed Fork" from the [original Series Seed repo](https://github.com/seriesseed/equity), as this set reflects more recent updates.

> [**Techstars**](https://www.techstars.com/content/blog/techstars-model-seed-funding-documents/): a set of model documents for an angel or seed financing in the $250k-$2M range (*represents “light” preferred equity financing and has very simple terms that are generally “balanced” but if anything lean toward the entrepreneurs and represents a great deal of trust in them*).

> [**Y-Combinator**](https://old.ycombinator.com/seriesaa/): a set of Series AA Equity Financing Documents originally created for YC-funded startups to use when raising equity rounds with angels, with the goal of making these financings easier and more streamlined for both sides. 

> [**National Venture Capital Association (NVCA)**](): a "template" set of model legal documents for venture capital investments put together by a group of leading venture capital attorneys.
